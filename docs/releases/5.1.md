## What's new

### Read-only panels

FieldPanels can now be marked as read-only with the `read_only=True` keyword argument, so that they are displayed in the admin but cannot be edited. This feature was developed by Andy Babic.

### Other features

 * Mark calls to `md5` as not being used for secure purposes, to avoid flagging on FIPS-mode systems (Sean Kelly)
 * Return filters from `parse_query_string` as a `QueryDict` to support multiple values (Aman Pandey)

### Bug fixes

 * Prevent choosers from failing when initial value is an unrecognised ID, e.g. when moving a page from a location where `parent_page_types` would disallow it (Dan Braghis)
 * Move comment notifications toggle to the comments side panel (Sage Abdullah)
 * Remove comment button on InlinePanel fields (Sage Abdullah)
 * Fix missing link to `UsageView` from `EditView` for snippets (Christer Jensen)
 * Prevent lowercase conversions of IndexView column headers (Virag Jain)

### Documentation

 * Document how to add non-ModelAdmin views to a `ModelAdminGroup` (Onno Timmerman)
 * Document how to add StructBlock data to a StreamField (Ramon Wenger)
 * Update ReadTheDocs settings to v2 to resolve urllib3 issue in linkcheck extension (Thibaud Colas)
 * Update documentation for `log_action` parameter on `RevisionMixin.save_revision` (Christer Jensen)
 * Reorganise snippets documentation to cover customisations and optional features (Sage Abdullah)

### Maintenance

 * Switch to ruff for flake8 / isort code checking (Oliver Parker)


## Upgrade considerations

### Changes to `wagtail.admin.navigation` helpers

All permission helpers from the `wagtail.admin.navigation` module are now methods on the `UserPagePermissionsProxy` class with minor naming changes:

- `get_pages_with_direct_explore_permission` is renamed to `pages_with_direct_explore_permission`
- `get_explorable_root_page` is renamed to `explorable_root_page` 
- `get_site_for_user` is renamed to `site_details`.

For example:

```python3
from wagtail.admin.navigation import get_explorable_root_page, get_site_for_user
root = get_explorable_root_page(user)
site_details = get_site_for_user(user)
```

should be rewritten to:

```python3
from wagtail.models import UserPagePermissionsProxy
root = UserPagePermissionsProxy(user).explorable_root_page()
site_details = UserPagePermissionsProxy(user).site_details()
```
